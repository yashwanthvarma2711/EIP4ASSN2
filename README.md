Reach:
1. Without directly converting the last step which is from 4x4 to 1x1(2560 parameters).I have convolved the 4x4 to 2x2 and then 1x1(to reduce the number of parameters)(1860 parameters). 
2. As the dropout is not used in the last iteration.We have removed from the code. ACCURACY-99.48% PARAMETERS-15812
